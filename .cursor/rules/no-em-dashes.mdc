# No Em Dashes

Never use em dashes (—) in any writing. Use alternative punctuation instead.

## Replacements

**Use a hyphen (-) for:**
- Compound modifiers: "AI-powered CLI"
- Ranges: "pages 1-10"

**Use a colon (:) for:**
- Introducing explanations: "Here's the problem: too many tools"
- Clarifications: "That's the key point: full lifecycle management"

**Use commas (,) for:**
- Parenthetical phrases: "The CLI, which is open source, handles deployments"
- Separating clauses: "Create content, deploy it, iterate on it"

**Use periods or semicolons for:**
- Separating complete thoughts into distinct sentences

## Examples

```markdown
❌ BAD: "The CLI handles everything—from content to deployment"
✅ GOOD: "The CLI handles everything: from content to deployment"

❌ BAD: "We built this—and it's open source"
✅ GOOD: "We built this, and it's open source"

❌ BAD: "Zero to production—all from one interface"
✅ GOOD: "Zero to production, all from one interface"
```

## Why

Em dashes create inconsistent formatting across different platforms and documents. Standard punctuation is clearer and more universally supported.
